**Gör din egen kunskapsinventering baserat på PHP The Right Way, berätta om dina styrkor och svagheter som du vill förstärka under kursen och det kommande året.**

Going through the content in "PHP The Right Way", I see that at this moment I've got a decent understanding of the basics but I still have a long road in front of me. For instance, there are areas that we've been working with during the education, like databases, error handling, documentation or testing, that I am familiar with but far from confident. Other areas like templating, deployment or virtualization are completely new to me. My goal for this course and the rest of the education is to consolidate the basics and get better understanding of the core parts of the language.  

**Vilket blev resultatet från din mini-undersökning om vilka ramverk som för närvarande är mest populära inom PHP (ange källa var du fann informationen)?**

According to the "Best PHP Frameworks for 2014", Laravel, Phalcon and Symfony2 were the top three frameworks at that moment. In 2018, Laravel is still the most used framework by far with 43.7% of the total for all frameworks. Then we have three frameworks fighting for the second position: CodeIgniter (14,9%), Symfony (13.6%) and Zend (12.5%). Other frameworks mentioned in this article are Yii2, CakePHP, FuelPHP, FatFree and Aura.

Some of the pros and cons for our top frameworks are the following:

Laravel is good for rapid application development, it supports MVC architecture, unit testing and it has very good documentation, but it does not work on shared hosting plans.

CodeIgniter supports normal web hosting with standard databases and it has good documentation, but it is not very friendly towards unit testing.

Symfony is well documented, its performance is very good and it is mature and stable, but it has a steep learing curve and it does not support MVC.

Zend is ideal for enterprise applications, it is object oriented, but it's not ideal for rapid application development.

**Berätta om din syn/erfarenhet generellt kring communities och specifikt communities inom opensource och programmeringsdomänen.**

I do not have much experience with communities other than ending up in Stack Overflow every time I am stuck in my code. I think it is a fantastic resource for quick fixes. As a beginner it can be difficult to separate the good answers from the bad. The voting system helps in that regard. Sometimes it is not even about the quality of the code, but to identify whether a suggested solution is appropriate for your specific problem.  

Another resource that I use frequently is the Ubuntu community forums. A fantastic resource for all Ubuntu/Linux in the open source community that got me out of trouble in many occasions.

I am a strong supporter of the open source community, for now just as a user but I hope in the future as a contributor also.    

**Vad tror du om begreppet “en ramverkslös värld” som framfördes i videon?**

A framework-less world where applications are build by selecting specific libraries for a project instead of being limited to a sometimes bloated framework seems a good idea to me. As a beginner I can benefit from the structure that a framework provides, but I can see the appeal for more experience developers of selecting just those specific libraries that are more appropriate for the a project without the limitations or impositions of any framework.

**Hur gick det att komma igång med din redovisa-sida?**

It went fine, but I chose to go for a simple layout with a simple stylesheet. I might update it during the course if I manage to catch up with the calendar, but it does the job for now.

**Några funderingar kring arbetet med din kontroller?
Vilken är din TIL för detta kmom?**

For the IP validation I played around with regex and the online tester at www.regex101.com, but I ended using the `filter_var` function to validate the addresses. I struggled a bit with the testing part of the assignment. It got a bit easier once I saw Mikael's suggestion in Gitter about using the `set_globals` function. My TIL for this week must be learning a bit about the different frameworks in PHP and an interesting peek into the PHP community.
